      <p>Howdy, my name is Daniel, but a lot of people call me &quot;Gonzo&quot;. People typically ask me what name I&apos;d like for them to call me by, and my usual response is that you can call me whatever you prefer!</p>
      <p>I recently graduated from MIT as a member of the Class of 2020 and I am now a proud employee of Microsoft!</p>
      <p>The plan is to turn this website into a blog, a portfolio for my photography and random coding projects, and a place for me to experiment and learn new things! I want to learn how to make this website 100% accessible, tested, and hopefully more in the process.</p>
      <p>I started down the path of using GatsbyJS for this project for their CMS bootstrapping, but I want to try to set that up and build it myself for the learning experience.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, if you want to get in touch with me, shoot me an email at my work email: danigon@microsoft.com or find me on Twitter @deafGonzo! (I have social media, I&apos;m just more responsive on Twitter or Email)</p>
      <p>Take care,</p>
      <p>Daniel &quot;Gonzo&quot; Gonzalez</p>
