      <h1>Gonzo.dev</h1>
      <p>Howdy, my name is Daniel, but a lot of people call me "Gonzo". People typically ask me what name I'd like for them to call me by, and my usual response is that you can call me whatever you prefer!</p>
      <p>I recently graduated from MIT as a member of the Class of 2020 and I am now a proud employee of Microsoft!</p>
      <p>The plan is to turn this website into a blog, a portfolio for my photography and random coding projects, and a place for me to experiment and learn new things! I want to learn how to make this website 100% accessible, tested, and hopefully more in the process.</p>
      <p>I started down the path of using GatsbyJS for this project for their CMS bootstrapping, but I want to try to set that up and build it myself for the learning experience.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, if you want to get in touch with me, shoot me an email at my work email: danigon@microsoft.com or find me on Twitter @deafGonzo! (I have social media, I'm just more responsive here)</p>
      <p>Take care,</p>
      <p>Daniel "Gonzo" Gonzalez</p>
